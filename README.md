# Eclipse Master Class

A tutorial of neat plugins, shortcuts and tweaks for [Eclipse](https://projects.eclipse.org).

This is mostly template code, plus a sequence of steps to follow to get it up and running.

## Getting it up and running

*Note: The goal is to run Eclipse in a Windows VM, to minimise disruption for Windows users.*

1. Grab a [Windows 7 VM](http://dev.modern.ie/tools/vms/mac/). Username: IEUser, Password: Passw0rd!
2. Grab an [Eclipse JEE installation](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/mars/R/eclipse-jee-mars-R-win32-x86_64.zip).
3. Activate "Do Not Disturb" mode.
4. Disable hot-corners and change the mouse scroll to "inverted".
5. Set up VM as a new guest machine. *The following steps are performed on the VM.*
6. Extract Eclipse.
7. Install Firefox (optional)
8. Install Git.
9. Install Java.
10. Clone this repository to a local folder.
11. In Eclipse, install the plugins [Infinitest](http://infinitest.github.io/), [MoreUnit](http://moreunit.sourceforge.net/#download) and [MouseFeed](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/mousefeed).
12. Import a similar formatter to that used by the session attendees.
